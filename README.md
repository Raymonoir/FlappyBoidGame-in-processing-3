# FlappyBoidGame-in-processing-3

<h1> Background </h1>

My first game coded in Processing 3, inspired by the "Flappy Bird" application for Iphone and android. I decided to create this after watching the youtube channel "Coding Train" and all of his creations in Processing 3.

<h1>Instructions</h1>

Processing 3 must be installed for use, The character " " (Space) increases the y acceleration in the upwards direction to make the boid "fly". If boid hits ceiling, floor or pipe the game is automatically restarted. Score is equal to number of pipes generated.
