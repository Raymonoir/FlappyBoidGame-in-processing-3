# FlappyBoidGame-in-processing-3
My first game coded in Processing 3, inspired by the "Flappy Bird" application for Iphone and android

A basic game in which the user controls a small bird or "boid" by pressing the space bar and the goal is just to get as high a score as possible by dodging incoming pipes.
